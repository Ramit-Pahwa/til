# Records: SQL for Humans

Records is another great project project by Kenneth Reitz, the core developer
(B.D.F.L) of Requests package. The package sticks to the simple philosophy of
uber simple APIs and *zen of Python* (type `import this` in Python prompt).

I have not yet used the project but looks cool.
